## General info
Project of a simple image processing app. 

## Image processing
The alghoritm used to process images changes histogram of that image in order to change the brightness and sharpness of the image.
The pixel RGB value is manipulated with:
* logarithmic function
* exponential function
* linear intervals

## Instruction
1. Open the program by running .py file.
2. Choose an image you want to make better
3. Choose the function you want to manipulate image with (logarithmic, exponential, linear) and set the coeffitients.
4. Click "Wygeneruj" - the processed image is saved on the computer.
